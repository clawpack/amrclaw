Run fix_maxmx.py in src/2d and examples directories
This gets rid of strings "maxmx,maxmy," and some other things (see the script)
Would need to be modified for 3d!

grep maxmx to look for other occurances

In stepgrid.f, first mx,my must be removed in 
  call step2(...)
  call src2(...)
  call b4step2(...)
in filpatch.f90, remove first mx_coarse - 2*nghost,my_coarse - 2*nghost in
  call setaux(...)
Are there other places where mx,my are passed in as maxmx,maxmy that were
not caught??

#----
geoclaw... after running fix_maxmx.py also had to do...

In geoclaw/src/2d/shallow/movetopo.f, first mx,my must be removed in 
  call setaux(...)

in geoclaw/src/2d/shallow/filpatch.f90, remove first mx_coarse - 2*nghost,my_coarse - 2*nghost in
  call setaux(...)

in geoclaw/src/2d/shallow/multilayer/filpatch_new.f90, remove first mx_coarse - 2*nghost,my_coarse - 2*nghost in
  call setaux(...)

In geoclaw/src/2d/shallow/surge/set_storm_fields
  maxmx, maxmy removed from colling sequence and declarations
  and from call to set_holland_storm_fields
