c    routine domain.
c    the spatial and temporal stepsizes are set. the node array
c    is kept as a linked list of free nodes.  "ndfree" points to the
c    head of the list, i.e. first free node.  use first row of each
c    col to hold this pointer, set by the macro "nextfree".
c    the free space list, managed in lfree, will have first and
c    last positions filled with an allocation of zero words,
c    to avoid boundary cases.
