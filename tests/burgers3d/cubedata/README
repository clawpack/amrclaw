3d Burgers' equation
       q_t  +  u*(.5*q^2)_x + v*(.5*q^2)_y + w*(.5*q^2)_z = 0

solved with u = v = w = 1.
The initial data consists of q=1 inside the cube [.1,.5] x [.1,.5] x [.1,.5]
and q=0 elsewhere.

Along every ray in the direction (1,1,1), the solution should look like a
shock followed by a rarefaction wave.

u,v,w are set in setprob.f
